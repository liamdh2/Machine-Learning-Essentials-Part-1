In this article, I offer you a listing of new IoT device ideas that you can use to get practice in designing your first IoT applications.\n"," <h1>Looking Back at My Coolest IoT Find in 2017</h1>\n"," Before going into detail about best new IoT device ideas, here’s the backstory. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><a class=\"preview\" href=\"http://bit.ly/LPlNDJj\" id=\"link 1\">Last month Ericsson Digital invited me</a></strong></span> to tour the Ericsson Studio in Kista, Sweden. Up until that visit, <a class=\"preview\" href=\"http://www.data-mania.com/blog/m2m-vs-iot/\" id=\"link 2\">IoT</a> had been largely theoretical to me. Of course, I know the usual mumbo-jumbo about wearables and IoT-connected fitness trackers. That stuff is all well and good, but it’s somewhat old hat – plus I am not sure we are really benefiting so much from those, so I’m not that impressed.\n"," \n"," It wasn’t until I got to the Ericsson Studio that I became extremely impressed by how far IoT has really come. Relying on the promise of the 5g network expansion, IoT-powered smart devices are on the cusp of an explosive growth in adoption. It was Ericsson’s Smart Car that sent me reeling:<a class=\"preview\" href=\"bit.ly/LPlNDJj\" id=\"link 3\"><img alt=\"Get your new iot device ideas here\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3802\" height=\"683\" src=\"http://www.data-mania.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/new-IoT-device-ideas.jpg\" width=\"1024\"/></a>\n"," \n"," This car is connected to Ericsson’s Connected Vehicle Cloud, an IoT platform that manages services for the Smart Cars to which it’s connected. The Volvo pictured above acts as a drop-off location for groceries that have been ordered by its owner.\n"," \n"," To understand how it works, imagine you’re pulling your normal 9-to-5 and you know you need to grab some groceries on your way home. Well, since you’re smart you’ve used Ericsson IoT platform to connect your car to the local grocery delivery service (<a class=\"preview\" href=\"http://mat.se/\" id=\"link 4\">Mat.se</a>), so all you need to do is open the Mat.se app and make your usual order. Mat.se automatically handles the payment, grocery selection, delivery, and delivery scheduling. Since your car is IoT-enabled, Mat.se issues its trusted delivery agent a 1-time token to use for opening your car in order to place your groceries in your car for you at 4:40 pm (just before you get off from work).\n"," \n"," To watch some of the amazing IoT device demos I witnessed at Ericsson Studio, make sure to go <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><a class=\"preview\" href=\"http://bit.ly/LPlNDJj\" id=\"link 5\">watch the videos on this page</a></strong></span>.\n"," <h1>Future Trends for IoT in 2018</h1>\n"," New IoT device ideas won’t do you much good unless you at least know the basic technology trends that are set to impact IoT over the next year(s). These include:\n"," <ol>\n"," <li><strong>Big Data</strong> &amp; Data Engineering: Sensors that are embedded within IoT devices spin off machine-generated data like it’s going out of style.

Be assured, that requires some serious data engineering.</li>\n"," <li><strong>Machine Learning</strong> Data Science: While a lot of IoT devices are still operated according to rules-based decision criteria, the age of artificial intelligence is upon us. IoT will increasingly depend on machine learning algorithms to control device operations so that devices are able to autonomously respond to a complex set of overlapping stimuli.</li>\n"," <li><strong>Blockchain</strong>-Enabled Security: Above all else, IoT networks must be secure.
